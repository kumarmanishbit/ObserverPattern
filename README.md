# ObserverPattern

# Definition:

The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Explanation:
  1 ) One to many dependency is between Subject(One) and Observer(Many).
  2 ) There is dependency as Observers themselves donâ€™t have access to data. They are dependent on Subject to provide them data.
